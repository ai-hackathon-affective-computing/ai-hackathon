 The concept

 With the Mobility System, minor tire damage can be sealed temporarily to enable continued travel. To accomplish this, sealant is pumped into the tires, which seals the damage from the inside.
The compressor can be used to check the tire inflation pressure.
Information

 - Follow the instructions on using the Mobility System found on the compressor and sealant container.
- Use of the Mobility System may be ineffective if the tire puncture measures approx. 1/8 inches/4 mm or more.
- Contact a dealer's service center or another qualified service center or repair shop if the tire cannot be made drivable.
- If possible, do not remove foreign bodies that have penetrated the tire.
- Pull the speed limit sticker off the sealant container and apply it to the steering wheel.
- The use of a sealant can damage the TPM wheel electronics. In this case, have the electronics checked at the next opportunity and have them replaced if needed.Storage

 The mobility system is in the left storage compartment of the cargo area.
Sealant container

3. Slide the sealing container into the holder on the compressor housing, ensuring that it engages audibly.
4. Screw the filling hose of the sealant container onto the tire valve of the nonworking wheel.
5. With the compressor switched off, insert the plug into the power socket inside the vehicle.
6. With operating readiness switched on or the engine running, switch on the compressor.Enclosed areas
Switch off the compressor after 10 minutes
Let the compressor run for max. 10 minutes to fill the tire with sealant and achieve a tire inflation pressure of approx. 2.5 bar.
While the tire is being filled with sealant, the tire inflation pressure may sporadically reach approx. 5 bar. Do not switch off the compressor at this point.
If a tire inflation pressure of 2 bar is not reached:
1. Switch off the compressor.
2. Unscrew the filling hose from the wheel.
3. Drive 10 m 10 m, approx. 400 inches 33 ft/10 m  forward and back to distribute the sealant in the tire.
4. Inflate the tire again using the compressor.
If a tire inflation pressure of 2 bar cannot be reached, contact your dealer's service center or another qualified service center or repair shop.Stowing the Mobility System

 1. Unscrew the filling hose of the sealant container from the wheel.
2. After pressing the red unlock button on the compressor, remove the sealing container.
3. Wrap the empty sealant container in suitable material to avoid dirtying the cargo area.
4. Stow the Mobility System back in the vehicle.Distributing the sealant

 Immediately drive approx. 10 km 10 km/5 mi 5 miles/10 km  to ensure that the sealant is evenly distributed in the tire.
Do not exceed a speed of 80 km/h 80 km/h/50 mph 50 mph/80 km/h .
If possible, do not drive at speeds less than 20 km/h 20 km/h/12 mph 12 mph/20 km/h .

Information for optimum effect of the airbags

 Optimum protective effect of the airbags
- Keep at a distance from the airbags.
- Always grasp the steering wheel on the steering wheel rim. Hold your hands at the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions, to keep the risk of injury to your hands or arms as low as possible when the airbag is triggered.
- Make sure that the front passenger is sitting correctly, i.e., keeps his or her feet and legs in the floor area and does not support them on the dashboard.
- Make sure that occupants keep their heads away from the side airbag.
- There should be no persons, animals or objects between an airbag and a person.
- Do not use the cover of the front airbag on the front passenger side as a storage area.
- Dashboard and windshield on the front passenger side must stay clear - do not attach adhesive labels or coverings and do not attach brackets or cables, e. g., for GPS devices or' mobile phones.
- Do not apply adhesive materials to the airbag cover panels, do not cover them or modify them in any way.
- Do not place slip covers, seat cushions or other objects on the front passenger seat that are not specifically suited for seats with integrated side airbags.
- Do not hang pieces of clothing, such as jackets, over the backrests.
- Never modify either the individual components or the wiring in the airbag system. This also applies to steering wheel covers, the dashboard, and the seats.
- Do not remove the airbag system.Even when you follow all instructions very closely, injury from contact with the airbags cannot be fully ruled out in certain situations.
The ignition and inflation noise may lead to short-term and, in most cases, temporary hearing impairment in sensitive individuals.

- Do not place any electronic devices on the passenger seat if a child restraint system is to be installed on it.
- Do not place objects under the seat that could press against the seat from below.
- No moisture in or on the seat.Indicator lamp for the front-seat passenger airbags

 The indicator lamp for the front-seat passenger airbag in the roofliner indicates the operating state of the front-seat passenger airbag.
The lamp indicates whether the airbags are either activated or deactivated.
After drive readiness is switched on, the lamp briefly lights up and then indicates whether the airbags are either activated or deactivated.
- The indicator lamp lights up when a child is properly seated in a child restraint fixing system or when the seat is empty. The airbags on the front passenger side are not activated.
- The indicator lamp does not light up when, for example, a correctly seated person of sufficient size is detected on the seat. The airbags on the front passenger side are activated.Detected child seats

 The system generally detects children seated in a child seat, particularly in child seats required by NHTSA when the vehicle was manufactured. After installing a child seat, make sure that the indicator lamp for the front-seat passenger airbags lights up. This indicates that the child seat has been detected and the front-seat passenger airbags are not activated. Strength of the driver's and front-seat passenger airbag

 The explosive power that activates driver's/front passenger's airbags very much depends on the positions of the driver's/front passenger's seat.

The system varies the steering angle of the wheels in relation to the steering wheel movement.
With strong steering movements and low speeds, for example when parking, the wheel angle is magnified, that is, the steering is more direct.
The rear axle steering acts to increase maneuverability by turning the rear wheels slightly in a direction opposite to the front wheels.
At higher speeds, the rear wheels are turned in the same direction as the front wheels.
In critical driving situations, the Integral Active Steering can stabilize the vehicle through purposeful steering of the rear wheels before the driver intervenes, for example in case of oversteering."

You can increase the engine's braking effect by shifting down, going all the way to first gear, if needed.
Brake disc corrosion

 Corrosion on the brake discs and contamination on the brake pads are furthered by the following circumstances:
- Low mileage.
- Extended periods when the vehicle is not used at all.
- Infrequent use of the brakes.Corrosion will built up when the maximum pressure applied to the brake pads during braking is not reached - thus discs don't get cleaned.
Corrosion buildup on the brake discs will cause a pulsating effect on the brakes in their response - generally that cannot be corrected."

For example, if the YYY amount equals 1,000 lbs and there will be four 150 lbs passengers in your vehicle, the amount of available cargo and luggage load capacity is 400 lbs: 1,000 lbs minus 600 lbs = 400 lbs.
5. Determine the combined weight of luggage and cargo being loaded on the vehicle. That weight may not safely exceed the available cargo and luggage load capacity calculated in Step 4.
6. If your vehicle will be towing a trailer, load from your trailer will be transfered to your vehicle. Consult the manual for transporting a trailer to determine how this may reduce the available cargo and luggage load capacity of your vehicle. Load

 The maximum load is the sum of the weight of the occupants and the cargo.
The greater the weight of the occupants, the less cargo that can be transported. The maximum load is the sum of the weight of the occupants and the cargo.
The greater the weight of the occupants, the less cargo that can be transported."

 Because of the aluminum roof, magnetic roof-mounted luggage racks cannot be used.
Loading

 Because roof-mounted luggage racks raise the vehicle's center of gravity when loaded, they have a major effect on vehicle handling and steering response.
Therefore, note the following when loading and driving:
- Do not exceed the approved roof/axle loads and the approved gross vehicle weight.
- Be sure that adequate clearance is maintained for tilting and opening the glass sunroof.
- Distribute the roof load uniformly.
- The roof load should not extend past the loading area.
- Always place the heaviest pieces on the bottom.
- Secure the roof luggage firmly, for example, tie with ratchet straps.

Basic information

 
									The manufacturer of your vehicle pursues a policy of constant development that is conceived to ensure that our vehicles continue to embody the highest quality and safety standards. In rare cases, therefore, the features described in this Owner's Manual may differ from those in your vehicle.
 
					
For Australia/New Zealand: basic information

 
									When reading this Owner's Manual, please bear the following in mind: to ensure that our vehicles continue to embody the highest quality and safety standards, we pursue a policy of continuous, ongoing development. Because modifications in the design of both vehicles and accessories may be introduced at any time, your own vehicle's equipment may vary from that described in this Owner's Manual. For the same reason, it is also impossible to guarantee that all descriptions will be completely accurate in all respects.

									We must therefore ask for your understanding of the fact that we are unable to recognize legal claims based on discrepancies between the data, illustrations and descriptions in this Owner's Manual and your own vehicle's equipment. Please also note that some of the optional equipment described in this Owner's Manual is not available on Australian models due to restrictions imposed by Australian Design Rules and other requirements.

									If you have any questions, your dealer's service center or another qualified service center or repair shop will be glad to advise you.

33509012_105.cml_Information_7	Information	"Data memory

 
		Many electronic components on your vehicle are equipped with data memories that temporarily or permanently store technical information about the condition of the vehicle, events and faults. This technical information generally records the state of a component, a module, a system or the environment:

		- 
- Operating mode of system components, fill levels for instance.
- 
- Status messages for the vehicle and from its individual components, e.g., wheel rotation speed/vehicle speed, deceleration, transverse acceleration.
- 
- Malfunctions and faults in important system components, e.g., lights and brakes.
- 
- Responses by the vehicle to special situations such as airbag deployment or engaging the stability control system.
- 
- Ambient conditions, such as temperature.
- 
		This data is purely technical in nature and is used to detect and correct faults and to optimize vehicle functions. Motion profiles over routes traveled cannot be created from this data. When service offerings are used, e.g., repair services, service processes, warranty claims, quality assurance, this technical information can be read out from the event and fault memories by employees of a dealer's service center or another qualified service center or repair shop, including the manufacturer, using special diagnostic tools. You can obtain further information there if you need it. After an error is corrected, the information in the fault memory is deleted or overwritten on a continuous basis.

		With the vehicle in use there are situations where you can associate these technical data with individuals if combined with other information, e.g., an accident report, damage to the vehicle, eye witness accounts — possibly with the assistance of an expert.

		Additional functions that are contractually agreed with the customer - such as vehicle emergency locating - you can transmit certain vehicle data from the vehicle."
33509012_105.cml_Information_8	Information	"Event data recorder EDR

 
					This vehicle is equipped with an event data recorder EDR. The main purpose of an EDR is to record, in certain crash or near crash-like situations, such as an airbag deployment or hitting a road obstacle, data that will assist in understanding how a vehicle's systems performed. The EDR is designed to record data related to the driving dynamics and safety systems for a short period of time, typically 30 seconds or less.

					The EDR in this vehicle is designed to record such data as:

					- 
- How various systems in your vehicle were operating.
- 
- Whether or not the driver and front passenger safety belts were fastened.
- 
- How far, if at all, the driver was depressing the accelerator and/or brake pedal.
- 
- How fast the vehicle was traveling.
- 
					This data can help provide a better understanding of the circumstances, in which crashes and injuries occur.

					EDR data is recorded by your vehicle only if a nontrivial crash situation occurs; no data is recorded by the EDR under normal driving conditions and no personal data, for example name, gender, age, and crash location, are recorded.

					However, other parties, such as law enforcement, could combine the EDR data with the type of personally identifying data routinely acquired during a crash investigation.

					To read data recorded by an EDR, special equipment is required, and access to the vehicle or the EDR is needed. In addition to the vehicle manufacturer, other parties, such as law enforcement, that have the special equipment, can read the information if they have access to the vehicle or the EDR.

					EDR data are recorded by your vehicle only if a nontrivial crash situation occurs; no data are recorded by the EDR under normal driving conditions and no personal data, e. g., name, gender, age, and crash location, are recorded.

					However, other parties, such as law enforcement, could combine the EDR data with the type of personally identifying data routinely acquired during a crash investigation.

					To read data recorded by an EDR, special equipment is required, and access to the vehicle or the EDR is needed. In addition to the vehicle manufacturer, other parties, such as law enforcement, that have the special equipment, can read the information if they have access to the vehicle or the EDR."

 The concept

 In the event of an accident, the system can bring the car to a halt automatically without intervention by the driver in certain situations. This can reduce the risk of a further collision and the consequences thereof.
At standstill

 After coming to a halt, the brake is released automatically.
Harder vehicle braking

 It can be necessary to bring the vehicle in certain situations to a halt quicker.
Here, a higher braking pressure must be generated for a short period when pressing the brake pedal than during automatic braking. This interrupts automatic braking.
Interrupting automatic braking

 It can be necessary to interrupt automatic braking in certain situations,for example for an evasive maneuver.
Interrupt automatic braking:
- By pressing the brake pedal.
- By pressing the accelerator pedal."

Run-flat tires are labeled with a circular symbol containing the letters RSC marked on the tire's sidewall. 1. Reduce your speed and stop cautiously. Avoid sudden braking and steering maneuvers.
2. Identify the damaged wheel. Do so by checking the tire inflation pressure using the Mobility System. If the tire inflation pressure in all tires is correct, the Flat Tire Monitor may not have been initialized. In this case, initialize the system.
3. Repair the flat tire with the Mobility System, refer to the BMW ALPINA Supplementary Owner's Manual, or change the damaged wheel. Do not continue driving without run-flat tires When a flat tire is indicated, DSC Dynamic Stability Control is switched on if needed."

- If the front-seat passenger airbags are activated, the indicator lamp does not light up. - The indicator lamp lights up when a child that is properly seated in a child restraint system intended for that purpose is detected on the seat. Airbags on the front passenger side are not activated.
Most child seats are detected by the system. 
Especially the child seats required by NHTSA at the time that the vehicle was manufactured. After installing a child seat, make sure that the indicator lamp for the front-seat passenger airbags lights up. This indicates that the child seat has been detected and the front-seat passenger airbags are not activated.

 The concept

 Video: high-beam Assistant Video: high-beam Assistant The high-beam Assistant detects other traffic participants early on and automatically switches the high beams on or off depending on the traffic situation. The assistant ensures that the high beams are switched on,  whenever the traffic situation allows. In the low speed range, the high beams are not switched on by the system.
General information

 The system responds to light from oncoming traffic and traffic driving ahead of you, and to adequate illumination, e.g., in towns and cities.
The driver can intervene at any time and switch the high beams on and off as usual.
In the equipment version with glare-free High-beam Assistant, the high beams are not switched off for oncoming vehicles, but only dimmed in the areas that blind oncoming traffic. In this case, the blue indicator light will stay on. If the headlights are switched when crossing the border into countries where vehicles drive on the opposite side of the road than in the country in which the vehicle is registered, the High-beam Assistant may only be available in a limited manner. Activating

 1. Turn the light reel to.
2. Press and hold button on turn signal lever.The indicator lamp in the instrument cluster is illuminated, when the low beams are switched on.
The high beams are switched on and off automatically.
The blue indicator lamp in the instrument cluster lights up when the system switches on the high beams.
Deactivating

 The High-beam Assistant is deactivated when manually switching the high beams on and off. To reactivate the High-beam Assistant, press the button on the turn signal lever.
System limits

 The High-beam Assistant cannot serve as a substitute for the driver's personal judgment of when to use the high beams. Therefore, manually switch off the high beams in situations where required to avoid a safety risk.
The system is not fully functional in the following situations, and driver intervention may be necessary:
- In very unfavorable weather conditions, such as fog or heavy precipitation.
- When detecting poorly-lit road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, horseback riders and wagons; when driving close to train or ship traffic; or at animal crossings.
- In tight curves, on hilltops or in depressions, in cross traffic or half-obscured oncoming traffic on highways.
- In poorly-lit towns and cities or in the presence of highly reflective signs.
- When the windshield behind the interior mirror is fogged over, dirty or covered with stickers, etc.
- When the windshield behind the interior mirror is fogged over, dirty or covered with stickers. Laser high beams

 The concept

 When the high beams are switched-on, starting with a speed of approx. 60 km/h 60 km/h, approx. 37 mph  the laser high beams in the headlamp are automatically switched on in addition to the LED high beams.
The range of the high beams is increased and ensures an even better illumination of the road.
Information

If the tire inflation pressure in all four tires is correct, the Tire Pressure Monitor may not have been initialized.

The possible driving distance after a loss of tire inflation pressure depends on cargo load, driving style and road conditions.
With an average load, the possible driving distance is approx. 80 km.
A vehicle with a damaged tire reacts differently, for example, it has reduced lane stability during braking, a longer braking distance and different self-steering properties. Adjust your driving style accordingly. Avoid abrupt steering maneuvers or driving over obstacles, for example, curbs, potholes, etc.
Because the possible driving distance depends on how the vehicle is used during the trip, the actual distance may be shorter or longer depending on the driving speed, road conditions, external temperature, cargo load, etc.
WARNING
Your vehicle handles differently when a run-flat tire is damaged and has low or missing tire inflation pressure, for example, your lane stability is reduced when braking, braking distances are longer and the self-steering properties will change. There is risk of an accident.
Drive moderately and do not exceed a speed of 80 km/h 80 km/h, 50 mph 50 mph/80 km/h .

In particular heavy trailers can start swinging when driving is continued with a flat tire. There is risk of accidents or risk of property damage.
Do not exceed a speed of 60 km/h 60 km/h, approx. 35 mph 35 mph/60 km/h  when driving with a trailer and a flat tire.
Immediately brake in the case of swinging. Apply necessary steering corrections as carefully as possible. Final tire failure

 Vibrations or loud noises while driving can indicate the final failure of a tire.
Reduce your speed and stop. Parts of tires can peel away, which could cause an accident. Do not continue driving; instead contact a dealer's service center or another qualified service center or repair shop. Reduce speed and stop; otherwise, pieces of the tire could come loose and cause an accident. Do not continue driving.

 Speed limit detection

 Video: speed limit detection Speed limit detection shows the current maximum permitted speed in the instrument cluster. The camera in the area of the interior mirror detects traffic signs at the edge of the road as well as variable overhead sign posts. Traffic signs with extra symbols, for example for wet road conditions, are considered and compared with the vehicle's onboard data, such as for the rain sensor. Next, the traffic sign will be displayed or ignored depending on the situation. The system takes into account the information stored in the navigation system and also displays speed limits present on routes without signs.

If the tire inflation pressure in all four tires is shown to be correct, it is possible that the Tire Pressure Monitor did not perform a reset. Then perform the reset.
If identification of flat tire damage is not possible, please contact a dealer's service center or another qualified service center or repair shop.
2. Repair the flat tire, e.g. with a tire repair kit or by changing the tire.Use of sealant, for example, the Mobility System, may damage the TPM wheel electronics. In this case, have the electronics checked at the next opportunity and have them replaced if needed."

 You may continue driving with a damaged tire at speeds up to 80 km/h 80 km/h, 50 mph 50 mph/80 km/h .

 If continuing to drive with a damaged tire:
1. Avoid sudden braking and steering maneuvers.
2. Do not exceed a speed of 80 km/h 80 km/h, 50 mph 50 mph/80 km/h .
3. Check the air pressure in all four tires at the next opportunity.
If the tire inflation pressure in all four tires is shown to be correct, it is possible that the Tire Pressure Monitor did not perform a reset. Then perform the reset.Possible driving distance with complete loss of tire inflation pressure:
The possible driving distance after a loss of tire inflation pressure depends on cargo load, driving style and road conditions.
A vehicle with an average load has a possible driving range of approx. 80 km 80 km, 50 miles 50 miles/80 km .
A vehicle with a damaged tire reacts differently, for example, it has reduced lane stability during braking, a longer braking distance and different self-steering properties. Adjust your driving style accordingly. Avoid abrupt steering maneuvers or driving over obstacles, for example, curbs, potholes, etc.
Because the possible driving distance depends on how the vehicle is used during the trip, the actual distance may be shorter or longer depending on the driving speed, road conditions, external temperature, cargo load, etc.

 The concept

 The tailgate can be opened and closed with no-touch activation using the remote control you are carrying. Two sensors detect a forward-directed foot motion in the center of the area at the rear of the car and the tailgate opens and closes.
Information

 Do not touch vehicle
If the remote control is in the sensor area, the tailgate can be closed or opened inadvertently by an unconscious or alleged recognized foot movement.
The sensor range reaches approx. 1.50 m 1.50 m, 5 ft 5 ft/1.50 m  behind the area at the rear of the car.
Danger of jamming
Area of movement
Foot movement to be carried out

 1. Place in the center behind the vehicle, about an arm's length from the vehicle rear.
2. Move a foot in the direction of travel as far under the vehicle as possible and immediately pull it back. With this movement, the leg must pass through the ranges of both sensors.The tailgate opens, regardless of whether it was previously locked or unlocked.
Before the opening, the hazard warning system flashes.
To close the tailgate, repeat the foot movement.
Before closing, the hazard warning system flashes and an acoustic signal sounds.
The closing of the tailgate has no effect on the locking of the vehicle. To avoid locking it into the vehicle, do not place the remote control in the cargo area.
Another foot movement can interrupt the closing operation."

With the realtime traffic information, the locations of traffic obstructions are provided in greater, more precise detail. Traffic conditions on roads other than the highways, for example, secondary roads and urban streets are also recorded and displayed for a wide area. Recommended detours can be calculated more accurately on the basis of this information. The risk of becoming caught in a further traffic obstruction on detour routes is reduced. If applicable, several detour recommendations or additional information may be offered.
When traveling in countries where realtime traffic information is not available, the traffic bulletins from the radio stations are still used.

 Safety measures

 - Park the vehicle as far away as possible from passing traffic and on solid ground. Switch on the hazard warning system.
- Set the parking brake and engage lever in position P P.
- Have all vehicle occupants get out of the vehicle and ensure that they remain outside the immediate area in a safe place, such as behind a guardrail.
- If necessary, set up a warning triangle or portable hazard warning lamp at an appropriate distance.
- Perform wheel change only on a flat, solid and slip-resistant surface. On soft or slippery ground, for example, snow, ice, tiles, etc., the vehicle or vehicle jack can slip away to the side.
- Do not place wood blocks or similar items under the vehicle jack; otherwise, it cannot reach its carrying capacity because of the restricted height.
- If the vehicle is raised, do not lie under the vehicle and do not start the engine; otherwise, a fatal hazard exists.

 If continuing to drive with a damaged tire:
1. Avoid sudden braking and steering maneuvers.
2. Do not exceed a speed of 80 km/h 80 km/h, 50 mph 50 mph/80 km/h .
3. Check the air pressure in all four tires at the next opportunity.
If the tire inflation pressure in all four tires is correct, the Flat Tire Monitor may not have been initialized. In this case, initialize the system.Possible driving distance with complete loss of tire inflation pressure:
The possible driving distance after a loss of tire inflation pressure depends on cargo load, driving style and road conditions.
A vehicle with an average load has a possible driving range of approx. 80 km 80 km, 50 miles 50 miles/80 km .
A vehicle with a damaged tire reacts differently, for example, it has reduced lane stability during braking, a longer braking distance and different self-steering properties. Adjust your driving style accordingly. Avoid abrupt steering maneuvers or driving over obstacles, for example, curbs, potholes, etc.
Because the possible driving distance depends on how the vehicle is used during the trip, the actual distance may be shorter or longer depending on the driving speed, road conditions, external temperature, cargo load, etc.
Continued driving with a flat tire
Continued driving with a flat tire and trailer Final tire failure

 Vibrations or loud noises while driving can indicate the final failure of a tire.
Reduce your speed and stop. Parts of tires can peel away, which could cause an accident. Do not continue driving; instead contact a dealer's service center or another qualified service center or repair shop. Reduce speed and stop; otherwise, pieces of the tire could come loose and cause an accident. Do not continue driving.
