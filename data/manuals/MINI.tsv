- Keep at a distance from the airbags.
- Make sure that occupants keep their heads away from the side airbag.
- Always grasp the steering wheel on the steering wheel rim. Hold your hands at the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions, to keep the risk of injury to your hands or arms as low as possible when the airbag is triggered.
- Make sure that the front passenger is sitting correctly, i.e., keeps his or her feet and legs in the floor area and does not support them on the dashboard.
- There should be no persons, animals or objects between an airbag and a person.
- Do not apply adhesive materials to the airbag cover panels, do not cover them or modify them in any way.
- Dashboard and windshield on the front passenger side must stay clear - do not attach adhesive labels or coverings and do not attach brackets or cables, e. g., for GPS devices or' mobile phones.

Remove rear luggage racks which are no longer required following use. Attached parts on the vehicle impair the aerodynamics and increase the fuel consumption."
34051458_341.cml_Saving_fuel_3	Saving fuel	"Closing the windows

 Open windows increase air resistance and therefore lead to greater fuel consumption. Close the windows and glass sunroof

 Driving with the glass sunroof and windows open results in increased air resistance and raises fuel consumption."
34051458_341.cml_Saving_fuel_4	Saving fuel	"Tires

 General information

 Tires can affect fuel consumption in various ways, for example, tire size may influence fuel consumption.
Check the tire inflation pressure regularly

 Check and, if needed, correct the tire inflation pressure at least twice a month and before starting on a long trip.
Low tire inflation pressure increases rolling resistance and thus raises fuel consumption and tire wear."
34051458_341.cml_Saving_fuel_5	Saving fuel	"Drive away without delay

 Do not wait for the engine to warm-up while the vehicle remains stationary. Start driving right away, but at moderate engine speeds.
This is the fastest way for the cold engine to reach its operating temperature."
34051458_341.cml_Saving_fuel_6	Saving fuel	"Look well ahead when driving

 Avoid unnecessary acceleration and braking.
By maintaining a suitable distance to the vehicle driving ahead of you.
Driving smoothly and proactively reduces fuel consumption."
34051458_341.cml_Saving_fuel_7	Saving fuel	"Avoid high engine speeds

 As a rule: driving at low engine speeds lowers fuel consumption and reduces wear.
Use 1st gear to get the vehicle moving. Starting with the 2nd gear, accelerate rapidly. When accelerating, shift up before reaching high engine speeds. When you reach the desired speed, shift into the highest applicable gear and drive with the engine speed as low as possible and at a constant speed. The gear shift indicator of your vehicle indicates the most fuel efficient gear."
34051458_341.cml_Saving_fuel_8	Saving fuel	"Use coasting conditions

 Signal tones

 When approaching an object, an intermittent sound indicates the position of the object. E. g. if an object is detected to the left rear of the vehicle, a signal tone sounds from the left rear speaker.
The shorter the distance to the object, the shorter the intervals.
If the distance to a detected object is less than approx. 25 cm 25 cm, approx. 10 in 10 inches/25 cm , a continuous tone is sounded.
With front PDC: if objects are located both in front of and behind the vehicle, an alternating continuous signal is sounded.
The signal tone is switched off, when selector lever position P is engaged on vehicles with Steptronic transmission. Volume

Steering is still responsive. You can still avoid any obstacles with a minimum of steering effort.
Pulsation of the brake pedal and sounds from the hydraulic circuits indicate that ABS is in its active mode.
Objects in the area around the pedals

 No objects in the area around the pedals
Driving in wet conditions

 When roads are wet, salted, or in heavy rain, press brake pedal ever so gently every few miles.
Ensure that this action does not endanger other traffic.
The heat generated in this process helps dry the brake discs and pads.
In this way braking efficiency will be available when you need it.
Hills

 Avoid stressing the brakes
Do not drive in neutral
Drive long or steep downhill gradients in the gear that requires least braking efforts. Otherwise the brakes may overheat and reduce brake efficiency.
You can increase the engine's braking effect by shifting down, going all the way to first gear, if needed.
Brake disc corrosion

 Corrosion on the brake discs and contamination on the brake pads are furthered by:
- Low mileage.
- Extended periods when the vehicle is not used at all.
- Infrequent use of the brakes.Corrosion will built up when the maximum pressure applied to the brake pads during braking is not reached - thus discs don't get cleaned.
Corrosion buildup on the brake discs will cause a pulsating effect on the brakes in their response - generally that cannot be corrected."

 Tires have a natural, consistent loss of tire inflation pressure.
Check the tire inflation pressure regularly
Regularly check the tire inflation pressure and correct it as needed: at least twice a month and before a long trip. If you fail to observe this precaution, you may be driving on tires with incorrect tire pressures, a condition that may not only compromise your vehicle's driving stability, but also lead to tire damage and the risk of an accident.
Tires heat up while driving, and the tire inflation pressure increases along with the tire's temperature. The tire inflation pressure specifications relate to cold tires or tires with the ambient temperature.
Therefore, only check the tire inflation pressure when the tires are cold. Only check the tire inflation pressure when the tires are cold. This means after driving no more than 1.25 miles/2 km or when the vehicle has been parked for at least 2 hours. When the tires are warm, the tire inflation pressure is higher.

 The manufacturer of your vehicle pursues a policy of constant development that is conceived to ensure that our vehicles continue to embody the highest quality and safety standards. In rare cases, therefore, the features described in this Owner's Manual may differ from those in your vehicle. For Australia/New Zealand: basic information

 When reading this Owner's Manual, please bear the following in mind: to ensure that our vehicles continue to embody the highest quality and safety standards, we pursue a policy of continuous, ongoing development. Because modifications in the design of both vehicles and accessories may be introduced at any time, your own vehicle's equipment may vary from that described in this Owner's Manual. For the same reason, it is also impossible to guarantee that all descriptions will be completely accurate in all respects.
We must therefore ask for your understanding of the fact that we are unable to recognize legal claims based on discrepancies between the data, illustrations and descriptions in this Owner's Manual and your own vehicle's equipment. Please also note that some of the optional equipment described in this Owner's Manual is not available on Australian models due to restrictions imposed by Australian Design Rules and other requirements.

34076683_76.cml_Information_6	Information	"Data memory

 Many electronic components on your vehicle are equipped with data memories that temporarily or permanently store technical information about the condition of the vehicle, events and faults. This technical information generally records the state of a component, a module, a system or the environment:
- Operating mode of system components, fill levels for instance.
- Status messages for the vehicle and from its individual components, e.g., wheel rotation speed/vehicle speed, deceleration, transverse acceleration.
- Malfunctions and faults in important system components, e.g., lights and brakes.
- Responses by the vehicle to special situations such as airbag deployment or engaging the stability control system.
- Ambient conditions, such as temperature.This data is purely technical in nature and is used to detect and correct faults and to optimize vehicle functions. Motion profiles over routes traveled cannot be created from this data. When service offerings are used, e.g., repair services, service processes, warranty claims, quality assurance, this technical information can be read out from the event and fault memories by employees of a dealer's service center or another qualified service center or repair shop, including the manufacturer, using special diagnostic tools. You can obtain further information there if you need it. After an error is corrected, the information in the fault memory is deleted or overwritten on a continuous basis.
With the vehicle in use there are situations where you can associate these technical data with individuals if combined with other information, e.g., an accident report, damage to the vehicle, eye witness accounts — possibly with the assistance of an expert.
Additional functions that are contractually agreed with the customer - such as vehicle emergency locating - you can transmit certain vehicle data from the vehicle."

 This vehicle is equipped with an event data recorder EDR. The main purpose of an EDR is to record, in certain crash or near crash-like situations, such as an airbag deployment or hitting a road obstacle, data that will assist in understanding how a vehicle's systems performed. The EDR is designed to record data related to the driving dynamics and safety systems for a short period of time, typically 30 seconds or less. 
The EDR in this vehicle is designed to record such data as:
- How various systems in your vehicle were operating.
- Whether or not the driver and front passenger safety belts were fastened.
- How far, if at all, the driver was depressing the accelerator and/or brake pedal.
- How fast the vehicle was traveling.This data can help provide a better understanding of the circumstances, in which crashes and injuries occur.
EDR data is recorded by your vehicle only if a nontrivial crash situation occurs; no data is recorded by the EDR under normal driving conditions and no personal data, e.g. name, gender, age, and crash location, are recorded.
However, other parties, such as law enforcement, could combine the EDR data with the type of personally identifying data routinely acquired during a crash investigation.
To read data recorded by an EDR, special equipment is required, and access to the vehicle or the EDR is needed.

- Clean roofliner with a microfiber cloth. Dampen cloth lightly with water.
- Do not soak the roofliner.
- To prevent water stains, mildew spots, and chafe marks, do not enclose the convertible top in the convertible top well for a long period and do not fold and stow the convertible top in the convertible top well while the top is wet or frozen.
- Remove water stains that may nevertheless have appeared on the roofliner using a microfiber cloth and an interior cleaner.
- When the vehicle is parked in enclosed areas for lengthy periods, ensure that the area is well ventilated.
- If possible, park the vehicle in the shade to protect it from intensive solar radiation so that color, rubber and fabric are not affected.
- Remove bird droppings immediately as their corrosive effect will otherwise attack the convertible top and damage the rubber seals.
- Hard to remove tree sap or bird droppings can be removed from the convertible top with special tree sap remover and a soft brush.Do not use spot remover
To remove heavy soiling, especially for light colored convertible tops, use a special convertible top cleaner.
Proceed as follows:
1. Spray the convertible top with the convertible top cleaner.
2. Make the convertible top cleaner foam up using a well saturated sponge, moving it in circular motions.
3. Finish washing the vehicle in the car wash or rinse with ample amounts of water.Otherwise, follow the instructions for use from the manufacturer.

 1. Locate the following statement on your vehicle's placard:
- The combined weight of occupants and cargo should never exceed XXX kg or YYY lbs. Otherwise, damage to the vehicle and unstable driving situations may result.
2. Determine the combined weight of the driver and passengers that will be riding in your vehicle.
3. Subtract the combined weight of the driver and passengers from XXX kilograms or YYY pounds.
4. The resulting figure equals the available amount of cargo and luggage load capacity.
For example, if the YYY amount equals 1,000 lbs and there will be four 150 lbs passengers in your vehicle, the amount of available cargo and luggage load capacity is 400 lbs: 1,000 lbs minus 600 lbs = 400 lbs.
5. Determine the combined weight of luggage and cargo being loaded on the vehicle. That weight may not safely exceed the available cargo and luggage load capacity calculated in Step 4.
6. If your vehicle will be towing a trailer, load from your trailer will be transfered to your vehicle. Consult the manual for transporting a trailer to determine how this may reduce the available cargo and luggage load capacity of your vehicle. Load

A damaged regular tire with low or missing tire inflation pressure impacts handling, such as steering and braking response. Run-flat tires can maintain limited stability. There is risk of an accident. Do not continue driving if the vehicle is not equipped with run-flat tires. Follow the information on run-flat tires and continued driving with these tires.
Continued driving with a flat tire

 If continuing to drive with a damaged tire:
1. Avoid sudden braking and steering maneuvers.
2. Do not exceed a speed of 80 km/h 80 km/h, 50 mph 50 mph/80 km/h .
3. Check the air pressure in all four tires at the next opportunity.
If the tire inflation pressure in all four tires is correct, the Flat Tire Monitor may not have been initialized. In this case, initialize the system. If the tire inflation pressure in all four tires is correct, the Tire Pressure Monitor may not have been initialized. In this case, initialize the system.Possible driving distance with complete loss of tire inflation pressure:
The possible driving distance after a loss of tire inflation pressure depends on cargo load, driving style and road conditions.
With an average load, the possible driving distance is approx. 80 km.
A vehicle with a damaged tire reacts differently, for example, it has reduced lane stability during braking, a longer braking distance and different self-steering properties. Adjust your driving style accordingly. Avoid abrupt steering maneuvers or driving over obstacles, for example, curbs, potholes, etc.
Because the possible driving distance depends on how the vehicle is used during the trip, the actual distance may be shorter or longer depending on the driving speed, road conditions, external temperature, cargo load, etc.
WARNING
Your vehicle handles differently when a run-flat tire is damaged and has low or missing tire inflation pressure, for example, your lane stability is reduced when braking, braking distances are longer and the self-steering properties will change. There is risk of an accident.
Drive moderately and do not exceed a speed of 80 km/h 80 km/h, 50 mph 50 mph/80 km/h .
WARNING
In particular heavy trailers can start swinging when driving is continued with a flat tire. There is risk of accidents or risk of property damage.
Do not exceed a speed of 60 km/h 60 km/h, approx. 35 mph 35 mph/60 km/h  when driving with a trailer and a flat tire.
Immediately brake in the case of swinging. Apply necessary steering corrections as carefully as possible. Final tire failure

 Vibrations or loud noises while driving can indicate the final failure of a tire.
Reduce your speed and stop. Parts of tires can peel away, which could cause an accident. Do not continue driving; instead contact a dealer's service center or another qualified service center or repair shop. Reduce speed and stop; otherwise, pieces of the tire could come loose and cause an accident. Do not continue driving. Contact a dealer's service center or another qualified service center or repair shop."

 Safety measures

 - Park the vehicle as far away as possible from passing traffic and on solid ground. Switch on the hazard warning system.
- Set the parking brake and engage lever in position P P.
- Have all vehicle occupants get out of the vehicle and ensure that they remain outside the immediate area in a safe place, such as behind a guardrail.
- If necessary, set up a warning triangle or portable hazard warning lamp at an appropriate distance.
- Perform wheel change only on a flat, solid and slip-resistant surface. On soft or slippery ground, for example, snow, ice, tiles, etc., the vehicle or vehicle jack can slip away to the side.
- Do not place wood blocks or similar items under the vehicle jack; otherwise, it cannot reach its carrying capacity because of the restricted height.
- If the vehicle is raised, do not lie under the vehicle and do not start the engine; otherwise, a fatal hazard exists.

37683505_522.cml_Tire_identification_marks_6	Tire identification marks	"Treadwear

 The treadwear grade is a comparative rating based on the wear rate of the tire when tested under controlled conditions on a specified government test course. For example, a tire graded 150 would wear one and one-half, 1 g, times as well on the government course as a tire graded 100. The relative performance of tires depends upon the actual conditions of their use, however, and may depart significantly from the norm due to variations in driving habits, service practices and differences in road characteristics and climate."
37683505_522.cml_Tire_identification_marks_7	Tire identification marks	"Traction

 The traction grades, from highest to lowest, are AA, A, B, and C.
Those grades represent the tire's ability to stop on wet pavement as measured under controlled conditions on specified government test surfaces of asphalt and concrete. A tire marked C may have poor traction performance.
The traction grade assigned to this tire is based on straight-ahead braking traction tests, and does not include acceleration, cornering, hydroplaning, or peak traction characteristics."
37683505_522.cml_Tire_identification_marks_8	Tire identification marks	"Temperature

 The temperature grades are A, the highest, B, and C, representing the tire's resistance to the generation of heat and its ability to dissipate heat when tested under controlled conditions on a specified indoor laboratory test wheel. Sustained high temperature can cause the material of the tire to degenerate and reduce tire life, and excessive temperature can lead to sudden tire failure. The grade C corresponds to a level of performance which all passenger car tires must meet under the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 109. Grades Band A represent higher levels of performance on the laboratory test wheel than the minimum required by law.
Warning: Temperature grade for this tire"
