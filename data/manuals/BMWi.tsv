 The Integrated Owner's Manual describes the standard, country-specific and optional equipment in a manner that for the most part is specific to the vehicle. If possible, only equipment is described that is actually installed in the vehicle. However, in individual cases equipment may be mentioned that is not present in the vehicle.
This also applies to safety-related functions and systems.
The respectively applicable country provisions must be observed when using the respective features and systems.

 Basic information

 The manufacturer of your vehicle pursues a policy of constant development that is conceived to ensure that our vehicles continue to embody the highest quality and safety standards. In rare cases, therefore, the features described in this Owner's Manual may differ from those in your vehicle. For Australia/New Zealand: basic information

 When reading this Owner's Manual, please bear the following in mind: to ensure that our vehicles continue to embody the highest quality and safety standards, we pursue a policy of continuous, ongoing development. Because modifications in the design of both vehicles and accessories may be introduced at any time, your own vehicle's equipment may vary from that described in this Owner's Manual. For the same reason, it is also impossible to guarantee that all descriptions will be completely accurate in all respects.
We must therefore ask for your understanding of the fact that we are unable to recognize legal claims based on discrepancies between the data, illustrations and descriptions in this Owner's Manual and your own vehicle's equipment. Please also note that some of the optional equipment described in this Owner's Manual is not available on Australian models due to restrictions imposed by Australian Design Rules and other requirements.
If you have any questions, your dealer's service center or another qualified service center or repair shop will be glad to advise you. Updates made after the editorial deadline

34354753_81.cml_Information_6	Information	"Data memory

 Many electronic components on your vehicle are equipped with data memories that temporarily or permanently store technical information about the condition of the vehicle, events and faults. This technical information generally records the state of a component, a module, a system or the environment:
- Operating mode of system components, fill levels for instance.
- Status messages for the vehicle and from its individual components, for example, wheel rotation speed/vehicle speed, deceleration, transverse acceleration.
- Malfunctions and faults in important system components, for example, lights and brakes.
- Responses by the vehicle to special situations such as airbag deployment or engaging the stability control system.
- Ambient conditions, such as temperature.This data is purely technical in nature and is used to detect and correct faults and to optimize vehicle functions. Motion profiles over routes traveled cannot be created from this data. When service offerings are used, for example, repair services, service processes, warranty claims, quality assurance, this technical information can be read out from the event and fault memories by employees of the dealer's service center or another qualified service center or repair shop, including the manufacturer, using special diagnostic tools. You can obtain further information there if you need it. After an error is corrected, the information in the fault memory is deleted or overwritten on a continuous basis.
With the vehicle in use there are situations where you can associate these technical data with individuals if combined with other information, for example, an accident report, damage to the vehicle, eye witness accounts — possibly with the assistance of an expert.
Additional functions that are contractually agreed with the customer - such as vehicle emergency locating - you can transmit certain vehicle data from the vehicle."
34354753_81.cml_Information_7	Information	"Event data recorder EDR

 This vehicle is equipped with an event data recorder EDR. The main purpose of an EDR is to record, in certain crash or near crash-like situations, such as an airbag deployment or hitting a road obstacle, data that will assist in understanding how a vehicle's systems performed. The EDR is designed to record data related to the driving dynamics and safety systems for a short period of time, typically 30 seconds or less.
The EDR in this vehicle is designed to record such data as:
- How various systems in your vehicle were operating.
- Whether or not the driver and front passenger safety belts were fastened.
- How far, if at all, the driver was depressing the accelerator and/or brake pedal.
- How fast the vehicle was traveling.This data can help provide a better understanding of the circumstances, in which crashes and injuries occur.
EDR data is recorded by your vehicle only if a nontrivial crash situation occurs; no data is recorded by the EDR under normal driving conditions and no personal data, for example name, gender, age, and crash location, are recorded.
However, other parties, such as law enforcement, could combine the EDR data with the type of personally identifying data routinely acquired during a crash investigation.
To read data recorded by an EDR, special equipment is required, and access to the vehicle or the EDR is needed. In addition to the vehicle manufacturer, other parties, such as law enforcement, that have the special equipment, can read the information if they have access to the vehicle or the EDR.

1. Avoid sudden braking and steering maneuvers.
2. Do not exceed a speed of 80 km/h 80 km/h, 50 mph 50 mph/80 km/h .
3. Check the air pressure in all four tires at the next opportunity.
If the tire inflation pressure in all four tires is shown to be correct, it is possible that the Tire Pressure Monitor did not perform a reset. Then perform the reset.Possible driving distance with complete loss of tire inflation pressure:
The possible driving distance after a loss of tire inflation pressure depends on cargo load, driving style and road conditions.
A vehicle with an average load has a possible driving range of approx. 80 km 80 km, 50 miles 50 miles/80 km .
A vehicle with a damaged tire reacts differently, for example, it has reduced lane stability during braking, a longer braking distance and different self-steering properties. Adjust your driving style accordingly. Avoid abrupt steering maneuvers or driving over obstacles, for example, curbs, potholes, etc.
Because the possible driving distance depends on how the vehicle is used during the trip, the actual distance may be shorter or longer depending on the driving speed, road conditions, external temperature, cargo load, etc.
Continued driving with a flat tire
Continued driving with a flat tire and trailer Final tire failure

 Vibrations or loud noises while driving can indicate the final failure of a tire.
Reduce your speed and stop. Parts of tires can peel away, which could cause an accident. Do not continue driving; instead contact a dealer's service center or another qualified service center or repair shop. Reduce speed and stop; otherwise, pieces of the tire could come loose and cause an accident. Do not continue driving.

 Your vehicle is equipped with ABS as a standard feature.

Steering is still responsive. You can still avoid any obstacles with a minimum of steering effort.
Pulsation of the brake pedal and sounds from the hydraulic circuits indicate that ABS is in its active mode. The pulsing of the brake pedal indicates that ABS is in its active mode. In certain braking situations, the perforated brake discs can cause functional problems. However, this has no effect on the performance and operational reliability of the brake. Objects in the movement area around pedals and floor area

 No objects in the area around the pedals
Driving in wet conditions

 When roads are wet, salted, or in heavy rain, press brake pedal ever so gently every few miles.
Ensure that this action does not endanger other traffic.
The heat generated in this process helps dry the brake discs and pads.
In this way braking efficiency will be available when you need it. Hills

 Avoid stressing the brakes
Do not drive in neutral
Drive long or steep downhill gradients in the gear that requires least braking efforts. Otherwise the brakes may overheat and reduce brake efficiency. You can increase the engine's braking effect by shifting down, going all the way to first gear, if needed. On downhill sections, use energy recovery if possible to decelerate the vehicle. Brake disc corrosion

 Corrosion on the brake discs and contamination on the brake pads are furthered by the following circumstances:
- Low mileage.
- Extended periods when the vehicle is not used at all.
- Infrequent use of the brakes.Corrosion will built up when the maximum pressure applied to the brake pads during braking is not reached - thus discs don't get cleaned.
Corrosion buildup on the brake discs will cause a pulsating effect on the brakes in their response - generally that cannot be corrected."

34383577_699.cml_Tire_damage_1	Tire damage	"Information

 Driving over rough or damaged road surfaces, as well as debris, curbs and other obstacles can cause serious damage to wheels, tires and suspension parts. This is more likely to occur with low-profile tires, which provide less cushioning between the wheel and the road. Be careful to avoid road hazards and reduce your speed, especially if your vehicle is equipped with low-profile tires. Indications of tire damage or other vehicle malfunctions:
- Unusual vibrations while driving.
- Unusual handling such as a strong tendency to pull to the left or right.Damage can, e. g., be caused by driving over curbs, road damage, or similar things.

 The concept

 With the Mobility System, minor tire damage can be sealed temporarily to enable continued travel. To accomplish this, sealant is pumped into the tires, which seals the damage from the inside.
The compressor can be used to check the tire inflation pressure.
Information

 - Follow the instructions on using the Mobility System found on the compressor and sealant container.
- Use of the Mobility System may be ineffective if the tire puncture measures approx. 1/8 inches/4 mm or more.
- Contact a dealer's service center or another qualified service center or repair shop if the tire cannot be made drivable.
- If possible, do not remove foreign bodies that have penetrated the tire.
- Pull the speed limit sticker off the sealant container and apply it to the steering wheel.
- The use of a sealant can damage the TPM wheel electronics. In this case, have the electronics checked at the next opportunity and have them replaced if needed.Enclosed areas Storage

With operating readiness or drive readiness switched on, switch on the compressor. Switch off the compressor after 10 minutes
Let the compressor run for approx. 3 to 8 minutes to fill the tire with sealant and achieve a tire inflation pressure of approx. 2.5 bar. Let the compressor run for max. 10 minutes to fill the tire with sealant and achieve a tire inflation pressure of approx. 2.5 bar. While the tire is being filled with sealant, the tire inflation pressure may sporadically reach approx. 5 bar. Do not switch off the compressor at this point.
If a tire inflation pressure of 2 bar is not reached:
1. Switch off the compressor.
2. Unscrew the filling hose from the wheel.
3. Drive 10 m 10 m, approx. 400 inches 33 ft/10 m  forward and back to distribute the sealant in the tire.
4. Inflate the tire again using the compressor.
If a tire inflation pressure of 2 bar cannot be reached, contact your dealer's service center or another qualified service center or repair shop.Stowing the Mobility System

 1. Remove the connection hose of the sealant container from the wheel. Unscrew the filling hose of the sealant container from the wheel.
2. Remove the connection hose from the sealant container. After pressing the red unlock button on the compressor, remove the sealing container.
3. Wrap the empty sealant container and connection hose in suitable material to avoid dirtying the cargo area. Wrap the empty sealant container in suitable material to avoid dirtying the cargo area.
4. Stow the Mobility System back in the vehicle.Distributing the sealant

1. Avoid sudden braking and steering maneuvers.
2. Do not exceed a speed of 80 km/h 80 km/h, 50 mph 50 mph/80 km/h .
3. Check the air pressure in all four tires at the next opportunity.
If the tire inflation pressure in all four tires is correct, the Flat Tire Monitor may not have been initialized. In this case, initialize the system.Possible driving distance with complete loss of tire inflation pressure:

A vehicle with an average load has a possible driving range of approx. 80 km 80 km, 50 miles 50 miles/80 km .
A vehicle with a damaged tire reacts differently, for example, it has reduced lane stability during braking, a longer braking distance and different self-steering properties. Adjust your driving style accordingly. Avoid abrupt steering maneuvers or driving over obstacles, for example, curbs, potholes, etc.
Because the possible driving distance depends on how the vehicle is used during the trip, the actual distance may be shorter or longer depending on the driving speed, road conditions, external temperature, cargo load, etc.

If the tire inflation pressure in all four tires is correct, the Tire Pressure Monitor may not have been initialized. In this case, initialize the system.Possible driving distance with complete loss of tire inflation pressure:
The possible driving distance after a loss of tire inflation pressure depends on cargo load, driving style and road conditions.
With an average load, the possible driving distance is approx. 80 km.
A vehicle with a damaged tire reacts differently, for example, it has reduced lane stability during braking, a longer braking distance and different self-steering properties. Adjust your driving style accordingly. Avoid abrupt steering maneuvers or driving over obstacles, for example, curbs, potholes, etc.
Because the possible driving distance depends on how the vehicle is used during the trip, the actual distance may be shorter or longer depending on the driving speed, road conditions, external temperature, cargo load, etc.
WARNING
Your vehicle handles differently when a run-flat tire is damaged and has low or missing tire inflation pressure, for example, your lane stability is reduced when braking, braking distances are longer and the self-steering properties will change. There is risk of an accident.
Drive moderately and do not exceed a speed of 80 km/h 80 km/h, 50 mph 50 mph/80 km/h .
WARNING
In particular heavy trailers can start swinging when driving is continued with a flat tire. There is risk of accidents or risk of property damage.
Do not exceed a speed of 60 km/h 60 km/h, approx. 35 mph 35 mph/60 km/h  when driving with a trailer and a flat tire.
Immediately brake in the case of swinging. Apply necessary steering corrections as carefully as possible. Final tire failure

 Vibrations or loud noises while driving can indicate the final failure of a tire.
Reduce your speed and stop. Parts of tires can peel away, which could cause an accident. Do not continue driving; instead contact a dealer's service center or another qualified service center or repair shop. Reduce speed and stop; otherwise, pieces of the tire could come loose and cause an accident. Do not continue driving.

The special high-voltage battery supplies the electric motor as well as the comfort features with power.
The high-voltage battery is charged via a charging cable, for example, when parked or while driving by energy recovery.
Charging can be done especially quickly via special power connections. However, charging via conventional power supply - at home - is also possible.
On the go, the energy recovery ensures that only little energy is lost when braking.
When the vehicle decelerates, the electric motor assumes the function of a generator and completely or partially converts the freed up motion energy into electrical power.
As a result the high-voltage battery is partially recharged in order to reach maximum range.

For example, if the YYY amount equals 1,000 lbs and there will be four 150 lbs passengers in your vehicle, the amount of available cargo and luggage load capacity is 400 lbs: 1,000 lbs minus 600 lbs = 400 lbs.

6. If your vehicle will be towing a trailer, load from your trailer will be transfered to your vehicle. Consult the manual for transporting a trailer to determine how this may reduce the available cargo and luggage load capacity of your vehicle."

A tire with low or missing tire inflation pressure impacts handling, such as steering and braking response. There is risk of an accident. Regularly check the tire inflation pressure, and correct it as needed, for example twice a month and before a long trip.
Tires heat up while driving, and the tire inflation pressure increases along with the tire's temperature. The tire inflation pressure specifications relate to cold tires or tires with the ambient temperature.
Only check the tire inflation pressure when the tires are cold. This means after driving no more than 2 km 2 km/1.25 miles 1.25 miles/2 km  or when the vehicle has been parked for at least 2 hours. When the tires are warm, the tire inflation pressure is higher.

37799777_257.cml_Lights_0	Lights	"Automatic headlamp control

 The concept

 The low beams are switched on and off automatically depending on the ambient brightness, for example in tunnels, in twilight or if there is precipitation.
General information

 A blue sky with the sun low on the horizon can cause the lights to be switched on.
When emerging from a tunnel during the day, the low beams are not switched off immediately but instead only after approx. 2 minutes.
The low beams always stay on when the fog lamp is switched on. Activating

 Position of switch: The indicator lamp in the instrument cluster is illuminated, when the low beams are switched on.
System limits

 The automatic headlamp control cannot serve as a substitute for your personal judgment of lighting conditions.
E.g. the sensors are unable to detect fog or hazy weather. To avoid safety risks under these conditions, you should always switch on the lights manually. Variable light distribution

 The concept

 This variable light distribution ensures that the roadway is still more effectively illuminated, depending on the vehicle speed.
The light distribution is automatically adjusted to the speed. The motorway beam pattern is switched on if for 30 seconds the speed is above 110 km/h 110 km/h, approx. 68 mph  or as soon as the speed exceeds 140 km/h 140 km/h, approx. 87 mph . The motorway beam pattern is switched of, as soon as a speed of 80 km/h 80 km/h, approx. 50 mph  is undercut.
