## Challenge: Empowering Digital Companions for Mobility Services via AI

The challenge aims at implementing a context-sensitive UI assistant using AWS services such as Alexa, Lex or Rekognition.
The context for your new service will come from your BMW: user profile of the driver, facial recognition, vehicle data, location, images of the vehicles surroundings, etc. Use all this together with third-party-skills (Spotify, TripAdvisor, you name it!) and surprise us with your ideas and prototype!
